# lolhttp

An HTTP Server and Client library for Scala.

## About the library

A server is built from a plain function accepting an HTTP request and eventually giving back an HTTP response. The computation is wrapped into an [effect](https://github.com/typelevel/cats-effect) and can handle pure & impure and synchronous & asynchronous scenarios. Requests and responses are just HTTP metadata along with a lazy content body based on [fs2](https://github.com/functional-streams-for-scala/fs2), making it easy to handle streaming scenarios if needed. For additional convenience, the library provides content encoders and decoders for the common scala types. Clients and Servers share the same API and the same concepts, making it easy to compose them. __SSL__ is supported on both sides.

## Hello World

```scala
// Let's start an HTTP server
Server.listen(8888) {
  case GET at "/hello" =>
    Ok("Hello World!")
  case _ =>
    NotFound
}

// Let's connect with an HTTP client
Client.runSync(Get("http://localhost:8888/hello")) { res =>
  res.readAs[String].map { contentBody =>
    println(s"Received: $contentBody")
  }
}
```

## Usage

The library is cross-built for __Scala 2.11__ and __Scala 2.12__.

The core module to use is `"com.criteo.lolhttp" %% "lolhttp" % "0.13.0"`.

There are also 2 optional companion libraries:

- `"com.criteo.lolhttp" %% "loljson" % "0.13.0"`, provides integration with the [circe](https://circe.github.io/circe/) JSON library.
- `"com.criteo.lolhttp" %% "lolhtml" % "0.13.0"`, provides minimal HTML templating.

## Documentation

The [API documentation](https://criteo.github.io/lolhttp/api/lol/index.html) is the main reference.

If you never used [cats effects](https://github.com/typelevel/cats-effect) before, you should start by having a quick look at it. Service [Responses](https://criteo.github.io/lolhttp/api/lol/http/Response.html) must be wrapped
into an `IO` (although there is an implicit conversion translating `Response` into a pure `IO` if needed). Also consuming the underlying content stream data is an effect. For asynchronous scenarios you have to deal with asynchronous effects, unless you prefer working with `Future` and wrapping it at the end using `IO.fromFuture`.

If you need to access the underlying content stream, you should first have a look a the [fs2 documentation](https://github.com/functional-streams-for-scala/fs2) to understand the basics.

For those who prefer documentation by example, you can also follow these hands-on introductions:

- [Hello world!](https://criteo.github.io/lolhttp/examples/HelloWorld.scala.html)
- [Serving files from classpath](https://criteo.github.io/lolhttp/examples/ServingFiles.scala.html).
- [A Github API client](https://criteo.github.io/lolhttp/examples/GithubClient.scala.html).
- [A JSON web service](https://criteo.github.io/lolhttp/examples/JsonWebService.scala.html).
- [Accessing an SQL Database](https://criteo.github.io/lolhttp/examples/DatabaseAccess.scala.html).
